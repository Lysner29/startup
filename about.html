            <br>
            Quest Haven Publishing is the publishing arm of Thomas C. Baggaley Music. 
            Its founding mission is to give greater exposure to today's most talented 
            and accessible composers and to foster the development and promotion of 
            the contemporary performing arts. As part of this mission, Quest Haven 
            Publishing sponsors and hosts the Living Composers Catalog, quickly becoming
            the #1 source for finding music by today's composers.
            <br><br>
            A recently announced new service by Quest Haven Publishing is the Commissions
            and Competitions. This service is designed to bring together composers and 
            performers for the creation and performance of new works. Other planned services 
            and events in the future include discussion groups and public chats, where 
            interested persons will have the opportunity to discuss topics relevant to music 
            in the 21st century, and small group discussions for member composers and 
            performers where participants will be able to present their works in progress 
            for feedback and evaluation.

            <h2>About the Living Composers Catalog</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            <br>
            The Living Composers Catalog (LCC), an essential part of the Quest Haven Publishing, 
            is designed to give performers, educators, music retailers and libraries increased 
            access to the music of today's composers. At the same time, the catalog serves 
            composers by allowing them to have their music distributed more widely, while 
            retaining for themselves many of the rights that are often surrendered to a 
            publisher. Publishing companies are also encouraged to take advantage of this 
            resource to promote the works of any living composers in their catalog.
            <br><br>
            The principal requirement for a work's inclusion in the catalog, not surprisingly, 
            is that the composer of that work must be alive. You won't find any works by Beethoven, 
            Brahms or Mozart in here, but you will find new works by some of today's most talented composers.
            <br><br>
            Quest Haven Publishing does not publish or distribute many of the works in the LCC. 
            It is provided as a search tool to help you find these works. Contact 
            information for purchasing score and parts is provided whenever the piece is found. We believe 
            that there is an awful lot of good, accessible music being produced today and 
            invite you to browse through our catalog and find something you'd like to try.
