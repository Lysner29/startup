            <h4>Hard to Find Music Series</h4>
            <p>
            A new feature for us, but one that is sure to grow in the future, 
            this series was created to help you find music to play for those 
            hard-to-find combinations of instruments. Browse through the works 
            we already have available, or if we don't have what you're looking 
            for yet, let us know what you need and we'll do our best to find it 
            for you and add it to our catalog. In some cases, we'll even go as 
            far as to commission a composer to write a new work for your instrumentation.

            <h4>New Versions of Old Favorites Series</h4>
